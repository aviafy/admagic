4. **Download**: Depends on browser download settings

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Button doesn't appear

**Issue**: Loading takes too long
- **Fix**: DALL-E can sometimes be slow, wait up to 60 seconds

**Issue**: Download doesn't work
- **Fix**: Check browser popup blocker and download settings

**Issue**: Error on generation
- **Fix**: Check backend is running and OpenAI API key is valid

**Issue**: Image doesn't show
- **Fix**: Check console for errors, verify network tab shows successful API call

## Demo Script

Want to impress someone? Try this demo flow:

1. "Let me show you our AI image generation"
2. Type: "a futuristic city at sunset"
3. "Watch these fun loading messages while DALL-E works"
4. [Wait for generation]
5. "See how DALL-E enhanced my simple prompt?"
6. "I can regenerate for a different variation"
7. [Click regenerate, wait]
8. "Or download it directly"
9. [Click download]
10. "And of course, submit it to our content feed"

## Metrics to Observe

While testing, note:
- How fast generation feels with fun messages
- Whether prompts comparison is useful
- If buttons are intuitive
- Any confusion points
- Overall "delight factor"
